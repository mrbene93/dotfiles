# Herbstluftwm
Go here: [herbstluftwm.org](http://herbstluftwm.org/)

This is my config files for the herbstluft manual tiling window manager.

And this is what my take on it currently looks like:

### Dependencies
- herbstluftwm
- dzen2
- [conky] (https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/)
- [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/)
- [i3lock](http://i3wm.org/i3lock/)
- [feh](http://feh.finalrewind.org/)
- [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)
- scrot

### What else do I use?
Exept for the necessary tools I use *rofi* as an application launcher and for prompts, like a shutdown prompt, *i3lock* as screen locker, *scrot* to take a screenshot for the lockscreen, *imagemagick* for blurring the screenshot for the lockscreen and *feh* as wallpaper manager. Many other applications are run via numerous keybindings.
